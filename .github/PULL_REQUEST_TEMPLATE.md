Nothing to do here, as the code is reformatted on build by [fmt-maven-plugin](https://github.com/spotify/fmt-maven-plugin).  If formatting changes do appear in the PR, please try to resolve that issue and reformat with a separate PR.

It is recommended that you download and install the latest [google-java-format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format) plugin for your IDE.
